                Management Information Systems (MIS) is the application of information technology to meet organizational and managerial requirements that can result in business value. Hence, MIS students are trained to use computer technology to help businesses get the right information to the right people at the right time. In the undergraduate program, students learn how to collect, manipulate, transform, and present data to support organizational needs, including presentation on company websites. They also learn about cybersecurity and how to protect organizational data.

                The Business Analytics graduate program helps students learn to analyze huge volumes and a variety of data, including those available through social media, through new tools and methods, such as visualization and machine learning, in order to generate business insights. In general, be it the undergraduate or graduate program, MIS students are trained to become business detectives with good analytical, business, communication, and problem-solving skills in a computer-based environment.
